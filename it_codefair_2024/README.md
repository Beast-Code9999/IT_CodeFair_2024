# Errors

1. No +[RCTConvert WKDataDetectorTypes:] function found - dataDetectorTypes prop problem

   ### Solution: 
   - Go to node_modules\react-native-pell-rich-editor\src\RichEditor.js
   - Delete the line dataDetectorTypes={'none'} (maybe in line 270)
   - run ```bash
      npm i patch-package
      ```
   - Go to package.json and add:
      ```bash
      "scripts": {
         "postinstall": "patch-package"
      }
      ```
   - Then run 
      ```bash
      npx patch-package react-native-pell-rich-editor
      ```
   You will see the folder named 'patches'
